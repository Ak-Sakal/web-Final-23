In my project:

User Authentication:

Implement a simple user authentication system. Users should be able to sign up, log in, and log out.

Task Management:

Users able to create, update, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
Display tasks in an organized manner, providing filters (e.g., all tasks, completed tasks, active tasks).

Backend Integration with MockAPI.io:

Utilize MockAPI.io to store and retrieve task data.
Implement AJAX requests to fetch and send data between the frontend and MockAPI.io.
Example: clone mockapi to your clean mockapi.io account

User Interface:

Design with intuitive and visually pleasing user interface for the task manager.
Include animations or transitions for a smoother user experience.

Responsive Design:

The task manager is responsive and works well on various devices.

Error Handling:
